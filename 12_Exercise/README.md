# Exercise 12

This directory contains two jupyter notebooks:

- the notebook "Exercise 12" contains all the exercise requested
- the notebook "AL for MNIST" contains a script to create a network that is able to produce fake copies of handwritten digits given a noise pattern or,even better, the digit we want to recreate. However, the model is still a work in progress.
